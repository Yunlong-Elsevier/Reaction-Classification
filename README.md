## Data

For legal reasons, the exact (processed, labeled and annotated) data that was used during this project at Elsevier can not be shared. 

### USPTO 1k TPL
We identified suitable public datasets USPTO 1k TPL here. which consists of 445k reactions divided into 1000 template labels. These labels were derived through a multi-step process: first, the USPTO dataset was atom-mapped using RXNMapper. Then, the template extraction workflow by Thakkar et al. was applied to identify the reaction templates. Finally, reactions corresponding to the 1,000 most frequent template hashes were selected and designated as class labels. The USPTO 1k TPL dataset is characterised by a significant imbalance in class distribution.

## Notebooks

We included all the necessary steps use for data preprocessing, model fine-tune, reaction embeddings and evaluation. 

However, for legal reasons, the pre-trained Bert Model, and all the fine-tune models were used during this project at Elsevier can not be shared.
